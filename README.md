# Simple Recommendation System

This project is a basic implementation of a *Recommendation System* that suggests items to users based on their preferences. It supports both *Collaborative Filtering* and *Content-Based Filtering* techniques and can be used to recommend *movies, **books, or **products*.

## 🚀 Features

- Recommend items to users based on similarity
- Supports Collaborative Filtering (User-User or Item-Item)
- Supports Content-Based Filtering using item features
- Simple and easy to understand implementation
- Customizable for movies, books, or e-commerce products

## 🧠 Recommendation Techniques

### 🔹 Collaborative Filtering
Uses historical interaction data (e.g., user ratings) to find similarities between users or items.
- *User-User Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends items liked by similar users.
- *Item-Item Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends items similar to ones the user liked.

### 🔹 Content-Based Filtering
Recommends items similar to the ones the user liked, based on item metadata or features.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (or Java, depending on your implementation)
- Pandas & Numpy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for similarity metrics in Python)
- CSV/JSON for datasets

## 📊 Example Dataset

The system can use any dataset with the following format:

*ratings.csv*
| user_id | item_id | rating |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 1       | 101     | 4.5    |
| 2       | 102     | 5.0    |

*items.csv*
| item_id | title            | genre        |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| 101     | The Matrix       | Sci-Fi       |
| 102     | Pride and Prejudice | Romance   |

Let me know if you’d like the README to be tailored for a **movie**, **book**, or **product** recommendation system specifically—or if you need it in Java!

# 🎯 Simple Recommendation System

A beginner-friendly project that builds a recommendation system using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**. Whether it's **movies**, **books**, or **products**, this system helps users discover items they'll love based on preferences or item features.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

This system analyzes user preferences or item details and generates personalized recommendations. It includes:

✅ Collaborative Filtering  
✅ Content-Based Filtering  
✅ Easy-to-use code structure  
✅ Support for different types of datasets (movies, books, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

### 📌 Content-Based Filtering
Recommends items similar to what a user already likes. Works by comparing item attributes (genre, category, etc.).

### 🤝 Collaborative Filtering
Finds users with similar tastes and recommends items they’ve liked. Uses rating patterns to spot similarities.
